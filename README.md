Open Wargaming Data Specification

Thought experiment: if there were a standardised set of specifications which could be used to describe tabletop wargames-related data, what would it look like?

* Unit profiles
* Rosters/Army Lists
* Game/turn scoring data
* Tournament scores (using the above) and results
* More???

In principle, any spec/schema should be flexible - it should work equally well for Warhammer, Infinity, Bolt Action, Stargrave, or whatever. In all likelihood this will mean a "master" spec, and several "extensions"

## Why?

Primarily for data portability and interoperability. Users could import/export their data from one list app to another; tournament apps could automatically import lists without worrying about users formatting them correctly; Stats aggregators could automatically pull in tournament results; with open data formats the possibilities are endless.
